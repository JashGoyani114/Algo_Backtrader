# Algo_Backtrader
To run the provided code and understand its functionality, you can follow these steps:

Import the necessary libraries:
python
Copy code
import backtrader as bt
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from cvxopt import matrix, solvers
from datetime import datetime
Define the strategy class MyStrategy that inherits from bt.Strategy. This class includes methods for calculating weights, reweighting the portfolio, and executing trades based on certain conditions. It uses the mean-variance optimization technique using the CVXOPT library for portfolio optimization.

Instantiate the MyStrategy class and define the necessary parameters and indicators within the __init__ method.

Define the calculate_weights method to compute the portfolio weights based on historical data using mean-variance optimization.

Define the reweight method to update the portfolio weights based on the calculated weights.

Define the reweight_monthly method to check if it is the first day of the month and call the reweight method accordingly.

Define the next method to call the reweight_monthly method at the start of each month and execute trades based on the defined conditions.

Read the data file containing stock prices using pd.read_csv and convert the date column to datetime format.

Create a cerebro instance, which is the main object that handles the backtesting process.

Add the MyStrategy to cerebro using cerebro.addstrategy(MyStrategy).

Iterate over each ticker in the data and create a bt.feeds.PandasData data feed for each ticker.

Add the data feed to cerebro using cerebro.adddata(data, name=ticker).

Set the initial cash using cerebro.broker.setcash(1000000).

Set the monthly timer using cerebro.add_timer(bt.Timer.SESSION_END, monthdays=[1]).

Print the starting portfolio value using cerebro.broker.getvalue().

Run the backtest using cerebro.run().

Print the final portfolio value using cerebro.broker.getvalue().

You can plot necessary graphs or calculate portfolio statistics using bt.analyzers.

Optionally, you can save the code and instructions in a README file to provide an overview of the backtesting process.

Please note that this code assumes you have the required libraries installed and have access to the data file containing the stock prices. Additionally, make sure to adjust the data file path and any other parameters specific to your use case.

It's important to mention that the provided code uses the Backtrader library for backtesting and assumes some familiarity with it. You might need to install it if you haven't done so already.
